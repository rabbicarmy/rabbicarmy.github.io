[Rabbi Carmy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalom_Carmy) teaches Philosophy and Jewish Studies at [Yeshiva University](https://www.yu.edu/faculty/pages/carmy-shalom). He has published a great deal on biblical theology and interpretation; modern Jewish thought (with an emphasis on Rabbis Soloveitchik and Kook); religious Zionism; liberal arts and religion; the interface of traditional Talmud study, modern scholarship, and theology; and the life of the thinking religious individual. He is Editor Emeritus of Tradition, where he wrote personal essays from 2004-2019 and is Contributing Editor at First Things, where for several years he wrote the monthly feature "Litvak at Large"  on Jewish and general subjects.

He is a prominent Modern Orthodox theologian, philosopher and writer. His primary teachers at Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary were Rabbis Aharon Lichtenstein and Joseph Soloveitchik. He has edited some of R. Soloveitchik’s work for publication. Carmy has written many articles on Biblical theology, Jewish thought, Orthodoxy in the 20th century and the role of liberal arts in a Torah education. He edited “Modern Scholarship in the Study of Torah: Contributions and Limitations”, “Jewish Perspectives on the Experience of Suffering” as well as several other works. In addition to his exegetical and analytic work, Carmy’s theological contribution is distinguished by preoccupation with the way religious doctrine and practice express themselves in the life of the individual.

A bibliography of most of his publications until 2014 appears in the Festschrift Rav Shalom Banayikh, edited H. Angel and Y. Blau.
